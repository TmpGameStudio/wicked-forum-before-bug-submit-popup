This is a discourse theme component that displays a popup with guidelines for bug reporting before the user submits their post. The popup appears when the user clicks the reply button.

The Wicked Bugs category can be configured with the settings, as well as the local storage name that remembers if the user doesn't want to show the guidelines anymore.

The popup only appears in the Wicked Bugs category.
